# image_sorter
Python scripts for image sorting

## sorter.py
this is a very unorganized script (I'll fix it up later) to sort the images based on orentaion 

## taufiq_updated_photo_collage_templates
This is a rip off of [insert_link_here](http://temp.com), however these templates provide more panning directions as well as CLEARLY labeling each composition based on the required orientation. It's a life saver imo. 

## Photos_Videos_Comps_To_Comps.jsx
This is the AE script that is used to map the image files to compositions with zero effort!
